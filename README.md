## Hi there 👋

My name is Marta and I am a Full Stack developer passionate about creating digital experiences that make a difference. My interest in web development began when I decided to complement my training in Industrial Design Engineering with the most advanced technologies for web application development. This path led me to study at the Ironhack bootcamp, where I delved into Fullstack MERN and developed projects that combine creativity and functionality.

Currently, my focus is on designing and building digital products that are optimized, accessible and focused on user experience, while continuing to explore new tools and trends in web development.
